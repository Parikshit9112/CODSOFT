# CODSOFT INTERSHIP TASKS : DATA SCIENCE

TASK 1 : 

Titanic Survival Prediction Dataset:

The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including whether they survived or not. 

In the Titanic Survival Prediction model, we use various features ( passenger class, age, gender,Port of Embarkation) to predict the target variable (survived)

Features :

  1.Pclass (Passenger Class)

  2.Age

  3.Fare

  4.Sex (Gender)

  5.Embarked (Port of Embarkation)

Target:
 
  1.Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Model Used : RandomForestClassifier


TASK 2 :

Sales Prediction Dataset:

The Sales Prediction dataset contains information about various factors that might influence sales.

In the Sales Prediction model, we used various features ( 'TV', 'Radio', 'Newspaper') to predict the target variable (sales).

Features :

   1.Television(TV)

   2.Radio

   3.Newspaper

Target:

   1.Sales

Model Used : LinearRegression


TASK 3 :

Iris Flower Classification Dataset:

The Iris dataset contains information about three species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. 

In the Iris Flower Classification model, we used the features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length) to predict the target variable (species).

Features:

   1.Sepal Length (cm)

   2.Sepal Width (cm)

   3.Petal Length (cm)

Target: 

   1.Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

Model Used : KNeighborsClassifier


TASK 4 :

Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset:

The Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset contains information about credit card transactions, including whether they are fraudulent or genuine. 

In the Credit Card Fraud Detection model, we use features such as 'Time', 'V1' through 'V28', and 'Normalized_Amount' to predict the target variable 'Class', which determines whether a transaction is fraudulent or genuine.

Features :

   1.Time: The number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.

   2.V1-V28: Principal components obtained through dimensionality reduction (anonymized features to protect user privacy).

   3.Amount: Transaction amount.

   4.Normalized_Amount: Transaction amount after normalization.

Target: 

   1.Class: Target variable indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or genuine (0).

Model Used : LogisticRegression
